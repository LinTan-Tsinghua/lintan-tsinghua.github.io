How do retail and institutional investors trade, and what are the underlying factors for these behaviors? Different from the United States, China's stock market has two prominent features. Dominance of retail investors and active participation by the government. After reviewing nearly 100 previous studies, we reach three conclusions. First, there are substantial heterogeneity in retail investors. Small retail investors have low financial literacy, exhibit behavioral biases, and not surprisingly, negatively predict future returns, whereas large retail investors and institutions are capable of processing information and positively predict future returns. Second, the macro- and firm-level information environment in China is slowly but gradually improving, which greatly affects trading behaviors of different investors, especially the more sophisticated institutional investors and large retail investors. Finally, the Chinese government actively adjusts their regulations on the stock market to serve the dual goals of growth and stability. Many regulations are effective, while some may generate unintended consequences.","tags":["Retail Investors","Institutional Investors","Government Regulation,","Information Efficiency,","Chinese Stock Market"],"title":"Retail and Institutional Investor Trading Behaviors: Evidence from China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charles M.

The marketable retail trading volumes rapidly rise from $325 billion in 2019 to $852 billion at mid-2020, and stay high for the next two years. The retail order flows positively predict cross-sectional returns over various horizons, and are associated with wider future effective spreads and higher future volatilities, as well as less market participations by high frequency traders and short-sellers. We find supportive evidence for informed and uninformed retail hypotheses. **(Presented at 2022 Plato Market Innovator (MI3) Conference, 2022 Transparency and Market Structure Conference, Tsinghua Finance Seminar Series.)**","tags":["Retail Investors","Liquidity","Volatility","High Frequency Trading","Short Selling"],"title":"When Price Discovery and Market Quality Are Most Needed: The Role of Retail Investors During Pandemic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lin Tan","Huihang Wu","Xiaoyan Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1727654400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1727654400,"objectID":"47e2571e16b89517d9fe29d44c42bd6e","permalink":"https://lintan-tsinghua.github.io/talk/preprint2/","publishdate":"2024-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/preprint2/","section":"talk","summary":"We examine whether large language models (LLMs) can extract contextualized representation of Chinese news articles and predict stock returns. The LLMs we examine include BERT, RoBERTa, FinBERT, Baichuan, ChatGLM and their ensemble model. We find that tones and return forecasts extracted by LLMs from news significantly predict future returns. The equal- and value-weighted long minus short portfolios yield annualized returns of 90% and 69% on average for the ensemble model. Given that these news articles are public information, the predictive power lasts about two days. More interestingly, the signals extracted by LLMs contain information about firm fundamentals, and can predict the aggressiveness of future trades. The predictive power is noticeably stronger for firms with less efficient information environment, such as firms with lower market cap, shorting volume, institutional and state ownership. These results suggest that LLMs are helpful in capturing under-processed information in public news, for firms with less efficient information environment, and thus contribute to overall market efficiency. **(Presented at at ABFER-JFDS Annual Conference on AI and FinTech 2024, China Fintech Research Conference (CFTRC) 2024, Summer Institute in Finance (SIF) Annual Conference 2024, Seminar Series at Sun Yat-Sen University, Tsinghua University and Summer Institute in Digital Finance (SIDF) 2024.)**","tags":["Retail Investors","Anomaly","Mispricing","FOMC","Profitability","Return prediction","News Articles","Large Language Models","Information Efficiency","Chinese Stock Market"],"title":"Large Language Models and Return Prediction in China","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Huimin Ge","Lin Tan","Huihang Wu","Xiaoyan Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1701043200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1701043200,"objectID":"b0b0967edf6dbdf3bdae0371753cd39e","permalink":"https://lintan-tsinghua.github.io/talk/preprint3/","publishdate":"2023-11-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/preprint3/","section":"talk","summary":"Robot investment assistants (RIAs) are designed to help individual investors with investment decisions by providing information and advice services. Using account level data between 2020 and 2021 from the largest mutual fund investment platform in China, we examine the values of different RIA services. Higher usage of RIAs is associated with higher future raw and risk-adjusted returns, higher diversification, risk-taking, and turnover for individual investors. We further find advice services, rather than information services, are playing a more important role in investors’ future returns and trading activities.
